This repository contains solutions to various LeetCode problems in different programming languages. The solutions are organized by the problem number and are available mainly in Python, but more langs are on the way :).

## Repository Organization

- **Every problem has its own folder**
- Inside that folder, you can drop your own solutions to the leetcode problem, in your `languague of preference.` (The name of the file must be the time it took to complete for leetcode and the memory used (both in ms and mb))

## Contributions

Contributions are welcome! If you have a more efficient solution, a solution in another programming language, or if you find any mistakes, feel free to open a pull request or an issue.

## Important Note

- Make sure to read and fully understand the problem before looking for the solution. Try to solve it on your own before referring to the solution here.

- The solutions provided here are intended to serve as reference and may not be the only way to solve a problem.
